# Tree_Based_Ensemble_Methods

This is my final project in the graduate course "computational statistics" at the University of Bonn. I evaluated the use of tree based ensemble methods, namely boosting and random forests. 
If you just want to read the work without looking at the code, I advice to just look at the file named "3082519_Text_Version.ipynb".
